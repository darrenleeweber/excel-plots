Visual Basic Macros</a></h2>
<h1>Excel Macro Utilities</h1>
<p>These macros provide some useful functions for converting data formats or 
creating/modifying ERP waveform plots.&nbsp; Excel macros are provided via ftp as 
*.bas and *.frm files. To use these files, start 
excel and goto 'tools - macro - visual basic editor (alt-F11)'.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ToolsMacroMenu.gif" width="484" height="430"> </p>
<p>When in the visual basic editor, goto 'file - import file' and select any of 
the *.bas or *.frm files. These files are loaded as a module or a form, 
respectively. Each module contains one or more 'sub' procedures, which can be 
selected from the drop-down menus over the main editor window. To run a sub 
procedure (or macro), use the run or debug menus.&nbsp; Most of the procedure 
names are long enough to give some idea of what they are designed to do.&nbsp; 
Please don't delete any procedures, as there are some dependencies between 
procedures within each module.&nbsp; An example of one of the form macros is 
described in <a href="excelmacro_top70plot.html">Excel Macro - Top70 ERP Plot</a>.</p>
<h2>Caution</h2>
<p>If it  goes wrong, check through the sub procedure to verify that paths 
and filename variables etc. are suitable for your data. Some of these macros are 
associated with interactive forms to facilitate their use, but the forms are new 
to me and only provided here as &quot;beta-versions&quot;.&nbsp; The macros here have been developed 
from the ground up, on one system/platform only.&nbsp;  Despite all efforts to &quot;program&quot; the computer properly, there 
will be something I've overlooked.&nbsp;  Should you feel 
so inclined, send an email describing the problem, to:
<a href="mailto:darren.weber@flinders.edu.au">Darren.Weber@flinders.edu.au</a>.</p>
<h2>For the Would Be Hackers</h2>
<p>I would encourage anyone to get into macro programming excel - it can save a 
lot of time and get better results than point-&amp;-click, &quot;RSI&quot; methods.&nbsp; To better understand any aspect of the macros, 
when in the visual basic editor, place a cursor over any 
statement and hit the F1 key for context-sensitive help. If the statement is a 
VB keyword and the help system files are installed, you should get useful 
information. Take some time to learn the object heirarchy of excel and you might 
be amazed by the simplicity of programming excel ;-) Most of the macros here 
were developed using this on-line help and recording small snippets of excel 
activities. This is a fast-n-furious way to become a VB programmer from the 
ground up - anyone with some understanding of OOP or a small book on Visual 
Basic should get the hang of it. The 
visual basic editor should be available for most installations of excel (I have 
been working with MS Office97 and OfficeXP professional).</p>
<h2>Warranties? Licences?</h2>
<p>These macros are provided with no implied or express warranties. Please use 
them and distribute them as you will, entirely at your own risk (please abide by 
the GPL if you redistribute these utilties, see <a href="http:/www.gnu.org">
http:/www.gnu.org</a>). Most of these macros been developed and tested on 
limited dataset specifications, please be careful to verify operations on <i>
your data</i>. Some of the macros are under development. If you have any advice 
or abuse, please send email to <a href="mailto:darren.weber@flinders.edu.au">
